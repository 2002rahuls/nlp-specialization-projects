# NLP Specialization Projects

This repository contains my implementations of key projects from the **Natural Language Processing Specialization** on Coursera.  
So far, I have completed **Autocomplete** and **Autocorrect**, with more projects to come as I progress.

## ðŸ”¹ Completed Projects

### 1. [Autocomplete](./autocomplete/)
- Built using **n-gram language models** with add-k smoothing
- Suggests the most probable next words given a prefix
- Covers vocabulary creation, n-gram counting, and probability estimation

### 2. [Autocorrect](./autocorrect/)
- Suggests corrections for misspelled words
- Combines **minimum edit distance (dynamic programming)** with word frequency
- Demonstrates string similarity and language modeling concepts
